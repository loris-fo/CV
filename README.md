#Loris Fochesato
I am a junior full-stack web developer who likes building applications with intuitive user stories, encapsulated code, and comprehensive testing. From February 3, 2015 to April 17, 2015, I completed a 12-week web development course at Makers Academy. I am currently seeking a junior developer role in London.

My non-coding interests include Motorsports competition, finance and african inspired organic products. My academic background is management, finance, and entrepreneurship. In my spare time, I like to enjoy a good book, do sports, and work on amazing projects like 3D printing architecture.

##Non-Technical Skills

###Communication

- I developed my communication skills through my Management degree at EDHEC Business School and also during my time working at Baiont Ltd working  as an Account Manager.

- Successfully liaised with clients across marketing, PR, HR and sales, culminating in some of the highest sales previously seen.

- Good at communicating how financial products work in a none technical way - learnt this whilst working for Baiont Ltd (I'm assuming talking about tech products can't be much harder). I took client's companies through their finances, understanding their needs, and helped them save on their costs using our product.

###Proactive Learning

- My 12 weeks at Makers Academy taught me that I'm able to quickly pick up technologies and implement them according to a brief.

- I always want to push myself to learn more. I have learnt how to use technologies that weren't on the curriculum at Makers Academy such as webRTC (I created my own MVP of Skype), implemented my own Augmented Reality scanner using a plugin and created my own mobile app.


- Big fan of Javascript technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, Mocha, Chai.

- Currently learning Angular.

- Always looking to learn how to learn in a better way.

###Problem solver

- Try and go through  a sheet of financial statistics and you'll understand what I mean!

- Came up with the concept for Proximibee to solve a marketing problem we identified.

- Love the creative process and solving real world problems by thinking laterally.

###Tenacity

- Proved this in my role as an Account Manager at InstructorLive in my success of attracting big clients over a long period of time.

###Code best practices

I became a Web Developer at Makers, coding from day 1 to the last. Although I was new to code, it has been natural for me to pick up how to code following good practices such as writing user stories, spend a lot of time thinking about the design of the application before I type a line of code, follow the SOLID principles and, last but not least, test drive!

###Entrepreneurship

I see opportunities everywhere, and I do everything to bring them to life. During my studies I participated in a challenge to create a company in less than 72 hours. The project that I pitched is currently backed by an incubator in Belgium and the first product should be on the market by 2016.
I am also building an e-commerce website to sale petrol-saving products for vehicles.


###Polyglot

- I was born in France, therefore my mother tongue is French.
- I speak fluent English.
- I lived in Spain during 15 years and speak perfectly spanish.
